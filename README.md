# Knights_Descent

This is a project that started off as a submission for the final year project in my BSc IT course (MDX).

This is a game within the roguelike deckbuilder genre that is HEAVILY inspired by games like Slay The Spire.
This game was developed in a few weeks so bugs are to be expected, along with unfinished / unpolished features!
